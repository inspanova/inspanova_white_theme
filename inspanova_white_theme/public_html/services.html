    <H4>Responsive Design Websites with HTML5 and CSS3</H4>
    <p>
        HTML5 is the successor of HTML 4.01, released for the first time in 1999. 
        The internet has changed significantly since 1999 and it seemed like the creation of HTML5 was necessary. 
        The new markup language was developed based on pre-set standards: New features should be based on HTML, CSS,
        DOM, and JavaScript. The need for external plugins (like Flash) needs to be reduced. Error handling should be
        easier than in previous versions. Scripting has to be replaced by more markup. 
        HTML5 should be device-independent. The development process should be visible to the public.

    <p>
        Java code is the most simpler and easiest technology to develop and maintain due to its well written format 
        and easily identifiable blocks. Reusability is the another hungry filling aspect of Java. Clients, service 
        providers and developers saves time and effort and they need not to reinvent the wheel every time. 
        Developers feel Java as the beautiful language ever identified.
